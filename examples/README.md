# Learning by Example

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Excited to have you here. Riot's examples serve as a tutorial for
building libraries and applications. Each example is a small complete project,
with its own README, and next steps to take.

You can start at [./0-hello-world](./0-hello-world) and work your way up.

* [0-hello-world](./0-hello-world) â€“ the smallest possible Riot program
* [1-spawn](./1-spawn) - creating your first process

### Coming Up

In future releases, as new work is done on the runtime and the Riot standard libraries, we'll be covering more topics such as:

* Agents
* Binary-string matching
* Best-practices around typing messages 
* Gen servers
* Application-level tracing
